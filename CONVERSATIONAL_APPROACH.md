# Conversational Apollo Tyres Chatbot

## Overview

The Apollo Tyres chatbot has been updated to provide a more conversational and interactive experience. Instead of immediately providing tyre recommendations, the chatbot now engages users in a dialogue to understand their specific needs and preferences.

## Conversational Flow

### 1. Vehicle Acknowledgment
When a user mentions their vehicle, the chatbot responds positively:
- **User**: "I have a Mahindra car, suggest tyres"
- **Bot**: "That's a nice car you have there! How do you drive? Long drives, off-roading, or city drive?"

### 2. Driving Pattern Questions
The chatbot asks about usage patterns:
- City driving vs highway driving
- Long trips vs short commutes
- Off-roading vs regular roads
- Load carrying requirements

### 3. Priority Assessment
Based on driving patterns, the chatbot asks about priorities:
- Fuel efficiency vs performance
- Comfort vs durability
- Budget considerations
- Weather and road conditions

### 4. Specific Recommendations
Only after gathering sufficient information, the chatbot provides personalized tyre recommendations with reasoning.

## Example Conversation Flow

```
User: "I have a Mahindra car, suggest tyres"
Bot: "That's a nice car you have there! How do you drive? Long drives, off-roading, or city drive?"

User: "Mostly city driving"
Bot: "Great! Since you drive mostly in the city, economy and comfort are important. Do you prioritize fuel efficiency, or are you looking for better performance and handling?"

User: "Fuel efficiency is important"
Bot: "Perfect! For city driving with fuel efficiency in mind, I'd recommend Apollo's Amazer 4G Life tyres. They're designed specifically for fuel economy and smooth city driving..."
```
